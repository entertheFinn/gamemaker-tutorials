gamemaker-tutorials
===================

A collection of simplified GameMaker Studio tutorials

The focus of these tutorials is to use GML scripting in a style as consistent
as possible with JavaScript since this is the first contact many are having
with scripting of any kind. The hope is skills will translate into
other mobile/web/unity3d game development using JavaScript, which has become
a very ubiquitous, very relevant, and highly optomized modern language.

These tutorials were made with GameMaker Studio Pro - Master Edition but
should work in free version of GameMaker Studio. [Please let me know if
they do not.]
